# Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards

This project consisted of building an interactive dashboard to explore a dataset including different belly button biodiversity. 

The interactive dashboard was created using Plotly.js to create a pie chart and bubble chart. Each key/value pair from the sample metadata JSON object was also displayed on the page. 

A Flask app was created and deployed to Heroku. https://belly-button-diversity-pm.herokuapp.com/
